Hi,

Quick note: Testing was not working so i've placed all files seperately, i've written a test but JUnit was playing up and my time ran out.
The code for the system works completely and you can test it directly in the Scanner class by simply creating items and scanning them

I hope you like it and i look forward to some feedback
Andrew
